# RareMD Assist

AI-powered diagnostic platform for rare genetic diseases. Built for iGEM 2025 Software Track.

## Problem
Rare genetic diseases affect 400+ million people worldwide, yet diagnosis takes an average of **7.6 years**. Physicians often lack specialized genetics expertise for prompt identification.

## Solution
Computational phenotype analysis platform that matches patient symptoms to rare diseases using standardized medical terminology and AI-powered decision support.

## Key Features
- **900+ Rare Diseases** with ORPHA codes
- **AI Photo Analysis** using OpenAI GPT-4o Vision
- **HPO Integration** for standardized symptom matching
- **Gene Panel Recommendations** via PubCaseFinder API
- **Clinical Decision Support** with treatment recommendations

## Core Features

**Disease Analysis Engine**
- Symptom-to-disease matching using HPO standardized terms
- Confidence scoring and ranking algorithms
- Integration with 900+ rare disease database

**AI Photo Analysis**
- Dysmorphic feature detection using computer vision
- Medical feature extraction and terminology mapping
